## Best Practices

### Project Structure

Employing an organized project structure is beneficial to your project and your team.

See the [./Unity/Assets/](./Unity/Assets/) folder for more info.

Scope Includes:
* Folder Structure
* Folder Naming
* File Naming

Benefits:

* Consistency — The project structure has consistency in presentation regardless of team location, spoken language, or individual programmers.
* Maintenance — Consistent project structure will aid readability. Readability helps new and existing programmers revisit the code base for fixes and improvements.
* Communication — Developers more implicitly understand each other in written and verbal communication.

### Coding Standards

Coding standards define a programming style. 

See the <a href="./Unity/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/RMC/Templates">./Unity/.../Templates/</a> folder for more info.

Employing organized coding standards is beneficial to your project and your team.

Scope Includes:

* Naming Conventions
* File Naming and Organization
* Formatting and Indentation
* Comments and Documentation
* Classes, Functions and Interfaces
* Testing

Benefits:

* Code Integration
* Team Member Integration
* Maintenance
* Uniform Problem Solving
* Minimizes Communication
* Minimizes Performance Pitfalls
* Saves Money Due to Less Man Hours
